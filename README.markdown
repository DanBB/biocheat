BioCheat - A Facebook Biotronic Cheat..er.. Hinter!
---------------------------------------------------

This project is a mix of different small things:
 - image processing (Training and recognition of patterns)
 - AI (Solving the Biotronics puzzle)
 - screen grabbing (ok, that's a oneliner :-))
 - visualizing the 'moves'

Usage
=====

 1. login to facebook and start the Biotronics application
 2. star this app
 3. tune the parameters to focus on the Biotronics gamefield (as shown on the screenshot)
 4. switch to the 'hint' visualization, as shown on Readme.png
 5. PLAY, and BEAT all your friends!!
 6. tell them you're not evil, but you're cheating ;-)

How to GET it
=============

Just get it from http://github.com/Eros/biocheat and open it with QtCreator,
so you can build and run it (ok, you can do the usual "qmake; make;" stuff
on the console/cmd.exe prompt if you like more ;-))
